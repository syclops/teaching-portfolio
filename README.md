# Steve Matsumoto's Teaching Portfolio

My teaching philosophy and selected teaching-related materials.

## Teaching Statement

The `statement/` directory contains my teaching statement.

## Teaching Materials

Th `materials/` directory contains samples of teaching materials I have created.
Examples of teaching materials that I may place in this directory include
syllabi, lecture notes, slides, problem sets, solution sets, and templates for
the above materials.

## Full Versions of Teaching Portfolios

The `releases/` directory contain past full versions of my teaching portfolio.
These versions were often made for some deadline; for example, the version from
December 23, 2013 was made for a teaching portfolio project I carried out as
part of the Future Faculty Program at Carnegie Mellon University. Each version
is only available in PDF form and named by the date on which it was completed.
